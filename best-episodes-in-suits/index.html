Have you ever found yourself wondering which episodes are the best? Well, look no further! In this post, we'll explore the top picks for the best episodes in Suits, and why they stand out from the rest.</p><p>If you're a die-hard fan of the show, you understand the importance of picking the right episodes to watch. You want to relive your favorite moments or watch the most iconic scenes. However, with nine seasons and 134 episodes, it can be overwhelming to choose which ones to watch, especially if you're short on time. </p><p>So, what are the best episodes in Suits? Let's dive in and find out.</p><p><strong>Summary of Best Episodes in Suits:</strong> In this post, we'll explore the top picks for the best episodes in Suits, including "Pilot," "The Other Time," "25th Hour," and "God's Green Earth." We'll discuss what makes each episode stand out and why they are worth watching. </p><p><h2>"Pilot" - The Beginning of a Great Series</h2></p><p>As the first episode of Suits, "Pilot" sets the foundation for the entire series. We are introduced to the show's two main characters, Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) and Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht). The episode opens with Mike, a brilliant college dropout, trying to make a living by selling marijuana. However, his life takes a dramatic turn when he meets Harvey, a hotshot lawyer at Pearson Hardman. </p><p>As the episode progresses, we see Harvey take a chance on Mike and hire him as his associate, even though he doesn't have a law degree. This leads to a series of events that ultimately changes both of their lives forever. "Pilot" is a great episode to watch if you want to understand the dynamic between Mike and Harvey and how their relationship evolves throughout the series.</p><p><h2>"The Other Time" - A Walk Down Memory Lane</h2></p><p>In "The Other Time," we get a glimpse into Harvey's past and how he became the successful lawyer he is today. The episode is set in a flashback, where we see Harvey and his former mentor, Cameron Dennis (Gary Cole), reunite after years of being apart. </p><p>The episode is a rollercoaster of emotions, as we see Harvey struggle with his past mistakes and try to reconcile with the people he's hurt along the way. "The Other Time" is a great episode for anyone who wants to understand Harvey's character development and how he became the man he is today.</p><p><h2>"25th Hour" - A Powerful Courtroom Drama</h2></p><p>"25th Hour" is one of the most powerful episodes in Suits, as it deals with the sensitive topic of death row. In this episode, Harvey takes on a pro bono case to defend a man who was wrongfully convicted of murder and is now facing the death penalty. </p><p>The episode is a gripping courtroom drama, as Harvey and his team fight to prove their client's innocence and save his life. "25th Hour" is a great episode for anyone who wants to see the legal side of Suits and how the characters handle a high-stakes case.</p><p><h2>"God's Green Earth" - A Heartwarming Finale</h2></p><p>"God's Green Earth" is the final episode of Suits, and it's a perfect ending to the series. The episode ties up all loose ends and gives fans closure on their favorite characters. </p><p>In this episode, we see Mike and Rachel (Meghan Markle) return to New York for Harvey and Donna's (Sarah Rafferty) wedding. The episode is a heartwarming reunion of all the characters we've grown to love over the years. "God's Green Earth" is a great episode for anyone who wants to say goodbye to their favorite characters and relive the best moments of the series.</p><p><h3>Why are these episodes the best?</h3></p><p>Each of these episodes stands out for different reasons. "Pilot" is the foundation of the series, "The Other Time" gives us insight into Harvey's character, "25th Hour" is a powerful courtroom drama, and "God's Green Earth" is a heartwarming finale. These episodes are the best because they showcase the show's strengths, including its writing, character development, and emotional depth.</p><p><h4>How to Watch These Episodes?</h4></p><p>If you're new to Suits, we recommend starting with "Pilot" and watching the series from the beginning. However, if you're short on time and want to watch the best episodes, you can watch "The Other Time," "25th Hour," and "God's Green Earth" without watching the entire series. These episodes are standalone and don't require much context to understand.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I watch these episodes without watching the entire series?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you can watch "The Other Time," "25th Hour," and "God's Green Earth" without watching the entire series. These episodes are standalone and don't require much context to understand. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Are there any other episodes worth watching?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, there are many other great episodes in Suits, including "Rewind," "Bad Faith," "Sucker Punch," and "The Shelf Life." However, these four episodes are the best of the best.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Where can I watch Suits?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> You can watch Suits on Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, or Hulu. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What makes Suits so popular?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Suits is popular because of its witty writing, complex characters, and thrilling storylines. The show has a little bit of everything, including humor, drama, and romance. </p><p><h2>Conclusion of Best Episodes in Suits</h2></p><p>In conclusion, Suits has many great episodes, but these four stand out from the rest. "Pilot," "The Other Time," "25th Hour," and "God's Green Earth" are the best of the best and showcase the show's strengths. Whether you're a die-hard fan or new to the series, these episodes are a must-watch. So grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy!</p></article>
