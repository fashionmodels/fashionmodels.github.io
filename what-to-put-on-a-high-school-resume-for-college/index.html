If yes, one of the essential documents you'll need is a resume. A high school resume for college is a document that highlights your achievements, skills, and experiences during your high school years. It can help you stand out from other applicants and increase your chances of getting accepted into your dream college.</p><p>However, putting together a high school resume for college can be overwhelming, especially if you're not sure what to include. You might be wondering what to put on a high school resume for college, how to make it stand out, and what mistakes to avoid.</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, we'll answer all your questions about what to put on a high school resume for college.</p><h2>What to Put on a High School Resume for College</h2><p>When creating your high school resume for college, you should include the following:</p><h3>1. Personal Information</h3><p>Start your resume by including your full name, address, phone number, and email address. Make sure your email address is professional and appropriate.</p><h3>2. Objective or Summary</h3><p>Include a brief objective or summary statement that highlights your goals and interests. This should be tailored to the college or program you're applying for.</p><h3>3. Education</h3><p>List your high school name, location, and graduation date. You can also include your GPA if it's above 3.0. If you've taken any college courses or earned any certifications, include them here as well.</p><h3>4. Extracurricular Activities</h3><p>List any clubs, sports teams, volunteer work, or leadership positions you've held during high school. This section shows that you're well-rounded and can balance academics with other activities.</p><h3>5. Work Experience</h3><p>If you've had any part-time jobs or internships during high school, include them here. Even if the job doesn't relate to your intended major, it shows that you have work experience and can handle responsibilities.</p><h3>6. Skills</h3><p>List any relevant skills you have, such as computer skills, language proficiency, or public speaking. Make sure to only include skills that you can demonstrate.</p><h2>Personal Experience</h2><p>When I was applying for college, I was unsure what to put on my high school resume. I had good grades, but I didn't have any extracurricular activities or work experience. However, I realized that I had a passion for music, and I had been playing the guitar for several years. I decided to include this on my resume, and I even created a separate section for it.</p><p>At my college interview, the admissions officer asked me about my music experience, and we ended up having a great conversation about it. Including my passion for music on my resume helped me stand out and showed that I had interests outside of academics.</p><h2>Mistakes to Avoid</h2><p>When creating your high school resume for college, here are some mistakes to avoid:</p><h3>1. Including irrelevant information</h3><p>Make sure to only include information that's relevant to the college or program you're applying for. Don't include hobbies or interests that don't relate to your intended major.</p><h3>2. Using unprofessional email addresses</h3><p>Make sure your email address is professional and appropriate. Avoid using nicknames or email addresses that include numbers or symbols.</p><h3>3. Focusing only on grades</h3><p>While good grades are important, colleges also want to see that you're well-rounded and can balance academics with other activities. Make sure to include extracurricular activities and work experience.</p><h3>4. Using a generic objective statement</h3><p>Make sure to tailor your objective or summary statement to the college or program you're applying for. Avoid using a generic statement that could apply to any college.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h3>Q: Should I include my SAT or ACT scores on my high school resume?</h3><p>A: No, you don't need to include your test scores on your high school resume. Colleges will receive your scores directly from the testing agency.</p><h3>Q: How long should my high school resume be?</h3><p>A: Your high school resume should be one page long. Make sure to only include relevant information and use concise language.</p><h3>Q: Can I include my social media profiles on my high school resume?</h3><p>A: Only include your social media profiles if they're professional and relevant to your intended major. Make sure to clean up your profiles and remove any inappropriate content.</p><h3>Q: Should I have someone else review my high school resume?</h3><p>A: Yes, it's always a good idea to have someone else review your high school resume. Ask a teacher, counselor, or parent to proofread it for errors and give feedback on the content.</p><h2>Conclusion of What to Put on a High School Resume for College</h2><p>Creating a high school resume for college can be daunting, but it's an essential document that can increase your chances of getting accepted into your dream college. Make sure to include personal information, an objective or summary statement, education, extracurricular activities, work experience, and skills. Avoid mistakes such as including irrelevant information, using unprofessional email addresses, focusing only on grades, and using a generic objective statement.</p></article>
