Here are some tips for caring for your t shirts:</p><p>- Always read the care label before washing</p><p>- Wash in cold water to prevent shrinking</p><p>- Hang or lay flat to dry to prevent stretching</p><p>- Avoid using bleach or fabric softener</p><p>- Iron on low heat if needed</p><p><h2>Personal Recommendations for Best Classic T Shirts</h2></p><p>Here are some of our top picks for the best classic t shirts:</p><p>- Hanes Men's ComfortSoft Short Sleeve T-Shirt</p><p>- Everlane The Cotton Crew</p><p>- Gap Vintage Wash Crewneck T-Shirt</p><p>- J.Crew Mercantile Broken-In Crewneck T-Shirt</p><p>These t shirts are all made from high-quality cotton, come in a range of fits and colors, and are affordable.
