The original owner of the clothes will receive a percentage of the sale, and the rest goes to the store.</p><p>It's important to note that consignment stores have guidelines for the clothing they will accept. Typically, they will only accept clothing in good condition that is in style and in season. They may also have specific requirements for certain types of clothing, such as designer items.</p><h3>Benefits of Consignment Stores</h3><p>One of the biggest benefits of consignment stores is that they offer an affordable option for those who want to buy second-hand clothing.
