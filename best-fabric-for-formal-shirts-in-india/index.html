These fabrics combine two or more materials to create a unique blend of qualities.

It's soft, lightweight, and has a beautiful sheen that sets it apart from other fabrics. Silk shirts are perfect for formal occasions and can be dressed up or down. However, silk is delicate and requires special care. It should be hand-washed or dry cleaned and should never be put in the dryer.</p><p>I've worn a silk formal shirt to a wedding and it looked and felt amazing.
