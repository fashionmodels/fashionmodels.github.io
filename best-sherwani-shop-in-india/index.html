Some of the other top shops include:</p><p><strong>1. Manyavar</strong> – With a wide range of styles and colors to choose from, Manyavar is a great choice for grooms who want a high-quality sherwani that won't break the bank.</p><p><strong>2. Raghavendra Rathore</strong> – Known for his classic designs and attention to detail, Raghavendra Rathore is a great choice for grooms who want a timeless and elegant look for their wedding day.</p><p><strong>3. Tarun Tahiliani</strong> – If you're looking for a more contemporary look, Tarun Tahiliani is the perfect choice. With modern designs and innovative materials, his sherwanis are perfect for grooms who want to make a statement.</p><p><h3>What to Look for in a Sherwani Shop</h3></p><p>When you're searching for the best sherwani shop in India, there are a few key factors to consider.

Here are a few tips to help you choose the perfect sherwani:</p><p><strong>1. Consider your body type</strong> – Different styles of sherwanis look best on different body types. If you're tall and slim, a fitted sherwani will look great on you. If you're shorter, a longer sherwani can help elongate your frame.</p><p><strong>2.

If you're unsure which colors to choose, ask your partner or wedding planner for advice.</p><p><strong>3.
