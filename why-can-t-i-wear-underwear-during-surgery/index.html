Underwear can harbor bacteria and other microorganisms that can spread throughout the room and increase the risk of infection.

It is important to follow these instructions carefully to ensure the success of the surgery and your safety during and after the procedure.</p><p>One of the instructions you may receive is to avoid wearing any underwear or other clothing that could compromise the sterile environment. This may include removing any piercings or jewelry as well. It is important to follow these instructions carefully and ask your doctor if you have any questions or concerns.</p><p><h4>How to Prepare for Surgery Without Underwear</h4></p><p>Preparing for surgery without underwear can be a little intimidating, but it is an important step to ensure your safety during the procedure. To prepare, you will need to wear loose-fitting clothing that is easy to remove and put back on. You may also be given a hospital gown to wear during the surgery.</p><p>It is important to shower before the surgery and avoid any lotions or creams that could interfere with the sterile environment. You may also be given special instructions on how to prepare for the surgery, such as taking a special bath or using a special soap to clean your skin.</p><p><h2>Personal Experience with Why Can't I Wear Underwear During Surgery</h2></p><p>During my own surgical procedure, I was instructed not to wear any underwear.
