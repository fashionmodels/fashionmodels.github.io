The Clothing Co and The Thrift Factory are two popular options for wholesale second hand clothing in Pretoria.</p><p>Personally, I've had the most success with The Clothing Co. Their prices are very reasonable and they have a wide selection of clothes to choose from. They also offer delivery for a small fee, which is very convenient if you don't have access to a car.</p><p>When purchasing from a wholesale supplier, it's important to keep in mind that most require a minimum order quantity.

Both have a great selection of clothes, and I've found some amazing deals there. The only downside is that you may need to visit several shops before finding exactly what you're looking for.</p><p><h3>Online Marketplaces</h3></p><p>If you're looking for a wide selection of second hand clothes without leaving your home, online marketplaces like Gumtree and OLX can be a great option. These sites allow you to buy directly from individual sellers, which can result in some great deals.</p><p>However, it's important to be cautious when buying from individual sellers online. Make sure to read the seller's reviews and ask for additional photos or information if needed. It's also a good idea to meet in a public place when picking up your purchase.</p><p><h4>Clothing Swaps and Flea Markets</h4></p><p>Finally, clothing swaps and flea markets can be a fun way to find second hand clothes at affordable prices. These events often have a wide selection of clothes to choose from, and you can often negotiate prices with the seller.</p><p>However, keep in mind that clothing swaps and flea markets are often held on specific dates and times, so you may need to plan ahead in order to attend.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of Where to Buy Second Hand Clothes in Bulk in Pretoria</h2></p><p>Buying second hand clothes in bulk in Pretoria can be a great way to save money and support sustainable fashion.
