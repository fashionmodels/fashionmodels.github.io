This will elongate your legs and add a touch of elegance to your outfit. You can opt for a neutral color like black or nude, or choose a bold color like red or blue to add some personality to your look.</p><p>When it comes to styling your strappy sandals, I recommend pairing them with a flowy maxi dress or a short cocktail dress. You can also add a statement necklace or earrings to complete your look.</p><p><h3>Ankle Boots: Add an Edgy Touch to Your Outfit</h3></p><p>If you're looking to add an edgy touch to your little black dress, ankle boots are a great option for shoes to go with little black dress.
